# Exploring-Trip-History-Dataset
Predicting Bike Rentors' Membership  -- Bike


This dataset comes from a bike sharing service in the United States. This dataset requires you to exercise your pro data munging skills. The data is provided quarter-wise from 2010 (Q4) onwards. Each file has 7 columns. It is a classification problem.

The objective is the exploration of the Capital Bikes Share Trip Dataset. I intend to explore the data, look at and plot the relationship between the variables. This is a classification issue that will make use of the Logistic Regression Algorithm to predict the likelihood that a certain combination of the Independent variables lead to a certain classification.

I shall explore a good number of hypothesis and deduce conclusions based on the output of the plots.

Some feasible hypothesis include but not limited to:

There is a relationship between the duration one stays with a bike and their membership type There is a link between the End station and the Member Type Most members start at Station Number 31014 There is no link between the duration one stays with a bike and an End station number
